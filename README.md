# PersonalVimConfig
Personal nvim configuration as a multi-language code-editing environment.

### Intro
This is done from the perspective of a CS student highly-interested in the place of HJKL
occupying a world dominated by the mouse. This is a culmination of my efforts to turn Vim into a syntax-linting,
code-completing, file-formatting juggernaut of a text editor which could hopefully deal with any new language
I decided to take a look at. 

I attempted this for two reasons. Firstly, I can't stand when I have to IDE hop in order to simply program in a 
different language, especially if all I'm writing is a quick python script to supplement the task I'm doing;
and secondly, how often I IDE hop in the same language just because:

**A** - I heard one IDE has a certain super feature proprietary to it.

**B** - I feel a sudden urge for an eco-system and impulse download all of JetBrains' products.

I would say this was achieved at some level with the combined work of many extremely powerful plugins I found. Nvim
can function very nicely in modern age as a code-editor. However, while getting more intuned with *VimScript* (the
language used for Vim plugins) I found that in the long run, Vim really is just a text-editor. Yes you can, and many have,
used VimScript in cheeky ways to get Vim do amazing things. But ultimately, I dont think 
Vim can truly turn into the fully fledged personal IDE I so wished it could, but it is certainly an amazing terminal
editor.

For this reason, I'm not really continuing my investigation into Vim other than maybe changing a couple of hotkeys here
and there and maybe tuning down a couple features to make it more apt for terminal editing and quick script writing.
See my emacs project for the continuation of my efforts.

### Important Things I Learnt
Customizing Vim becomes extremely simple after you properly learn how to do it. Plugin managers (like vim.plug)
do 95% of the work for you.

In Vim, it's very easy
to use only a few of the hotkeys Vim has to offer and still get away with *maybe* a performance increase
relative to regular mouse-based operation. However, it is only once you start actively Googling some operation you want
to execute in Vim (such as replacing a word or upcasing a highlighted section) that you will truly reach your potential
as a keyboard champion.

Vim may seem like alien tech at first, but if you learn the basics of customizing it like loading a plugin, binding
a new normal mode hotkey or even changing the theme, you'll begin tp understand how Vim itself functions both boosting
your remembrance of hotkeys as well as what you can and can't customize. Its only through use that you will learn Vim
fast and consistently.

After extensive usage of Vim hotkeys, it can be very easy to try use them **to detrimental effect** in the many, many
instances where they are not actually available to you. Not really an issue, just an observation.
