# nvim-config
This repo has been stripped down and even though I still use it, is now somewhat *defunct*.

I've moved on to [doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) for all my programming needs and mainly just use this nvim config for scripts and quick edits from the terminal.

There will always be a place in my heart for vim and in a perfect world it would cater to my every need (this one ain't it though, chief).

P.S. In my opinion, [ALE](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) still holds the crown in terms of asynchronous syntactical checking, but one day [COC](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) will snatch it away!
